    - ⚡ Fun fact : When I was around 3 years old and that I had my first day at kindergarden, I didn't cry. But the second
    day, when my mom left, I cried for nearly 1 hour reaching my hands toward the window because I thought my mom abandoned
    me. And the other days went normal haha, I don't know what went into my head this day !
